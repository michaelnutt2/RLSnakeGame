You're good
Oof
I can't believe you've done this!
You shall rue the day!
I will have my revenge!
It's merely a flesh wound
You're mom would be proud!
Why am I only here to suffer?
Wow your actually decent
Look at those moves!
Welp that wasn't right
I didn't see that coming
I won't give up!
En gard√©!
That won't work!
I can do better!
I will win!
Who do you think you are?
I'll show you!
How dare you!
You're not my friend anymore
You were my brother!
You will try!
Give me a break
That was not clever
"Well, that was your last chance"
You think you can win?
You are playing with fire
All right!
Foolish
The true fight after this
The future is not written
Time to tip the scale
Yikes
I'll give you that one
It's not that serious...
Tryhard
I'm not finished yet!
